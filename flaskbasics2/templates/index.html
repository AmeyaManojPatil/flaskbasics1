	<h2>Learn about Pandas!</h2>
	<p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a bear native to the mountainous regions of central China. Recognized by its distinctive black and white fur, the giant panda has black patches around its eyes, ears, and across its limbs. Adult pandas weigh between 70 to 100 kg (154 to 220 lbs) and can grow up to 1.2 to 1.9 meters (4 to 6 feet) in length. They primarily feed on bamboo, although they are technically omnivores, occasionally eating other plants or small animals. Due to habitat loss and low birth rates, giant pandas are considered vulnerable, with extensive conservation efforts in place to protect them.</p>
